# üîß Email Notification Fix - SMTP Server Issue

## Problem Identified
The email notifications are not working because the Network Solutions SMTP servers are not reachable from your hosting environment. This is a common issue with hosting providers that block certain SMTP connections.

## Root Cause
- `smtp.networksolutions.com` - DNS resolution failed
- `mail.networksolutions.com` - Connection refused (ports 465, 587, 25)
- `outgoing.networksolutions.com` - DNS resolution failed

## Solution: Switch to Gmail SMTP

Gmail SMTP is more reliable and widely supported by hosting providers.

### Step 1: Set up Gmail App Password

1. Go to your Gmail account settings
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication if not already enabled
3. Go to Security ‚Üí App passwords
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character app password

### Step 2: Update .env Configuration

Replace the email configuration in your `.env` file with:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail SMTP)
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=true
MAIL_USE_SSL=false
MAIL_USERNAME=your-gmail@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=your-gmail@gmail.com
```

### Step 3: Alternative - Use contact@lelabubu.ca with Gmail

If you want to keep using contact@lelabubu.ca as the sender:

1. Add contact@lelabubu.ca as an alias in your Gmail account
2. Verify the alias
3. Use these settings:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail SMTP with custom sender)
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=true
MAIL_USE_SSL=false
MAIL_USERNAME=your-gmail@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=contact@lelabubu.ca
```

### Step 4: Deploy and Test

1. Update your `.env` file on Render with the new settings
2. Redeploy your application
3. Make a test purchase to verify email notifications work

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: SendGrid (Recommended for Production)
- More reliable for transactional emails
- Better deliverability
- Free tier available

### Option 2: Contact Network Solutions
- Ask for current SMTP server settings
- Verify if they've changed their server names
- Check if there are any authentication requirements

### Option 3: Use Render's Email Service
- Check if Render offers email services
- Some hosting providers have built-in email solutions

## Testing the Fix

After updating the configuration, you can test it by:

1. Making a test purchase on your website
2. Checking the Render logs for email sending confirmation
3. Verifying the email arrives in your inbox

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Webhook Configuration**: Working correctly
‚úÖ **Stripe Integration**: Working correctly  
‚ùå **Email Notifications**: SMTP server unreachable
üîß **Fix Required**: Update SMTP configuration

The webhook is receiving payment events correctly, but the email sending is failing due to SMTP connectivity issues.
